function [Sx,alphao,fo]=autofam(x,fs,df,dalpha)
%   AUTOFAM(X,FS,DF,DALPHA) computes the spectral auto-
%   correlation density function estimate of the signals X
%   by using the FFT Accumulation Method(FAM). Make sure that
%   DF is much bigger than DALPHA in order to have a reliable estimate.
%
%   INPUTS:
%   X       - input column vector;
%   FS      - sampling rate;
%   DF      - desired frequency resolution;
%   DALPHA  - desired cyclic frequency resolution
%
%   OUTPUTS:
%   SX     - spectral correlation density function estimate;
%   ALPHAO  - cyclic frequency;
%   FO      - spectrum frequency;
